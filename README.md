GR8Conf 2012 Workshop
=======

This project contains materials related to a workshop I'm running / have run at Gr8conf 2012. The purpose of the workshop is to give the participants hands-on experience building a responsive application in which the presentation and services layers are separated (i.e. the server sends data only to the front end, which is capable of rendering itself via Javascript & templates). In addition, there is a short presentation on the merits of this approach and why Grails is an excellent choice for building such an app.

The contents of this mostly fall within the sample Grails app, called 'twitterMonitor', which has a handful of purposes:

1.	To serve up the sample application that participants will re-create, called 'twitterMontir' 
2.	To host the presentation, written in full html + javascript 

The other main file is an Instructions document detailing the steps the participants should follow to successfully build the application
